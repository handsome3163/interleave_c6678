# interleave_c6678
interleaved modular multiplication on tms320c6678


here is a interleaved modular multiplication (IMM) on TI DSP TMS320C6678


"interleaved.py" is a IMM code by Python (IMM test code)

"interleaved.c"  is a IMM code by C on CCSv5

"mult.asm"       is called by interleaved.c


by the way, mult.asm is for single core and is still not perfect

if you cannot set up CCSv5, you should read "how2setup_CCS.txt"
