# interleave_c6678
interleaved modular multiplication on tms320c6678

here is a interleaved modular multiplication (IMM) on TI DSP TMS320C6678짜n

"interleaved.py" is a IMM code by Python (IMM test code)짜n
"interleaved.c"  is a IMM code by C on CCSv5짜n
"mult.asm"       is called by interleaved.c짜n

by the way, mult.asm is for single core and is still not perfect
if you cannot set up CCSv5, you should read "how2setup_CCS.txt"
